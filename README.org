* iLimb Control
This project is for the controlling and modeling of the iLimb robot hand. All the programs communicates with the robot hand through serial port.

** Requirements
So far MATLAB is needed for the program. 

** How to Run 

Here is a few predefined commands that you use through serial port. 

** Keyboard Code Keys
